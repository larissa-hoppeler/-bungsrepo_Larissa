    <p>Given the dire projection on global warming and ocean acidification, humans increasingly look to technology for creative solutions. In Under a White Sky, author Elizabeth Kolbert pointed to “control” as the fundamental false logic of the Anthropocene:
        “If control is the problem, then, by the logic of the Anthropocene, still more control must be the solution.” As we navigate an increasingly delicate political atmosphere, techno-solutionism dominates conversations about climate change. Artificial
        intelligence has become the star of the techno-solutionist way of thinking with its promises of creative problem-solving packaged in a “black-box technology”. The technology comes with its own human-imposed biases – what do we optimize, and who
        do we optimize for? When we try to compute an uncomputable system, whose needs do we consider and prioritize? YANTO looks at some of the technologies we use in aquafarming today and imagines a future where artificial intelligence takes them to
        an extreme.</p>
