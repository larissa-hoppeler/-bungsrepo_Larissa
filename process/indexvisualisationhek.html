    <p>The audience interact with the installation through a mobile interface and navigate through a speculative underwater environment with a smartphone. This virtual environment is endless and can be navigated in every direction. The sonic sound experiences
        are specially composed for this aquafarming simulation and respond to all movements and navigation modes. In the exhibition space, the display of the smartphone could be projected onto a large wall. Through the point-of-view of an A.I. simulator,
        the audiences are invited to swim with the engineered/mutated species, and create new simulations to observe the changing ecosystem. When the audience approaches a species, they will have the chance to learn about the speciesâ€™ backstory. We hope
        to invite the audience to investigate our tendency to engineer nature and treat ecosystems as a system that can be fixed.</p>
