    <p>Due to increasing acidification and industrial aquaculture, our oceans are becoming increasingly uninhabitable. Aquaculture workers, veterinarians and scientists are now looking to genetic engineering, synthetic biology and machine learning as potential
        tools to mitigate climate change. YANTO - yaw and not tip over imagines a speculative aquaculture farm 30 years from now, where artificial intelligence takes on the task of optimizing synthetic species to withstand the increasingly hostile marine
        environment. Through the perspective of an AI simulator, the audience is invited to swim with the manipulated/mutated species and observe the changing ecosystem. YANTO responds to the trend toward technology-assisted solution finding by constructing
        narratives about an unpredictable system under extreme control - what are we optimizing, and what are we ignoring? The project aims to examine our tendency to simplify complex ecosystems by treating nature as a system that can be fixed.</p>
